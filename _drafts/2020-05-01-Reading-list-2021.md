# Reading list 2021

This is a collection of documents (PDFs), links or general things that I find useful. Hope you will enjoy reading them as much as I did.

### CCSK Study guide
The Certified Cloud Security Knowledge (CCSK) is an examination offered by the Cloud Security Alliance for anyone who is interested in cloud security. This is a vendor nutral summary of security capabilties that you should expect from a cloud vendor.

My first interaction (*as with many of us*) with cloud was through the eyes of a vendor so my judgement was ***clouded*** when it come to assessing another vendor. This guide helped me to realise what to expect; and most importantly what **good** looks like from cloud perspective. 

I highly recommend to anyone who is relatively new into security in the cloud or just interested in learning new and exciting, everchanging world of cloud security!

Knowing your audience is critical for effective communication. As you might expect, the same principle applies to design presentations too.

Preparing to deliver a design presentation requires time and effort; so never **under-estimate**.

I presented a design to a prospective client recently. On first reaction, I thought I had done a pretty good job, but on reflection I wish I had more. 

My aim in this post is to highlight my shortcoming so you will not make the same mistakes!

## Motivations
The motivations are factors that led me to the Solution. I highlighted the need to leverage local knowledge and buy-in from **stakeholders**. What I did not mention was the concept of a MVP (more on this later).

The area that I did not cover on the outset was **cybersecurity**. As designers and architects we are trained to deliver secure solutions and its an implied achitectural characteristic. Although it is implied, there is no harm highlighting it upfront. It is best to highlight principles such as **authentication** (authN) and **authorisation** (authZ) at this point.
Not all stakeholders are tech-savy and they just wanted to be assured that security is being considered.

The **cost** of change is an interesting factor to highlight early on. There are two areas that require redress; capex and opex. I remember being part of architural discussions where the collectionly agree design was cost prohibitive. There is a close link between the design and cost therefore stakeholder would like to know it is being considered.  

The **time-to-market** is so important these days and designed are expected consider
 Minimum Viable Product (**MVP**) approach from group up. The MVP approach is a great influencer as stakeholder are able to see some return on their investments early on. 

The **technology** is an interesting factor to consider early on. I think there is no harm considering the existing technology stack as the cost could increase if plethora of technologies are introduced.

## Solution options
Once the motivations are disussed, the next phase is to consider solution options. This is the **rubber-meet-the-road** moment where you'll make yourself available to the client by using your theory, pratice and experience to ensure clients intentions are met.

In my case, I had three bullet points each discribing an option in one sentence. Instead of this format, I wish I had added advantages and disadvangaes for each, perhaps a table as following.

Option|Performance|Security|Complexity
------|-----------|--------|----------
Option 1|High|High|Low
Option 2|Low|Low|High

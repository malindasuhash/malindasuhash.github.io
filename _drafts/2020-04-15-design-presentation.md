Knowing your audience is critical for effective communication. As you might expect, the same principle is applicable for design presentations too.

Preparing to deliver a design presentation require time and effort; so never **under-estimate**.

I presented a design to a prospective client recently. On first reaction, I thought I had done a pretty good job, but on relection I wish I had covered done more. 

My aim of this post is to highlight my shortcoming so that I can refer back in the next opportunity.

## Motivations
The motivations are factors that led me to the end solution. I highlighted the need to leverage local knowledge and buy-in from **stakeholders**. 

The area that I did not cover was **cybersecurity**. As designers and architects we are trained to deliver security solution and its an implied achitectural characteristic. Not all stakeholders are tech-savy and they just want assurance that it is being considered. Even though security is implied, it is critical to highlight during early engagement. 

The **cost** of change (capex) is an interesting factor to highlight early on. I remember being part of architural meeting where the collectionly agree design is cost prohibitive. There is a close link between the design and cost therefore stakeholder would like to know it is being considered.  

The **time-to-market** is such an important part of today's market driven forces and
 Minimum Viable Product (**MVP**) plays a significant part of it.

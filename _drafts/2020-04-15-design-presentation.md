Knowing your audience is critical for effective communication. As you might expect, the same principle applies to design presentations too.

Preparing to deliver a design presentation requires time and effort; so never **underestimate**.

I presented a solution design to a prospective client recently. On first reaction, I thought I had done a pretty good job, but on reflection I wish I had more. 

My aim in this post is to highlight my shortcoming and hopefully other can learn from it.

## Assumption
It is OK to make good assumptions. A good assumption is resonable one considering the limited knowledge of the client. In my case I did not make enough assumptions, instead I waited till I met the client. 

## Motivations
The motivations are factors that led me to the Solution. I highlighted the need to leverage local knowledge and buy-in from **stakeholders**. What I did not mention was the concept of a MVP (more on this later). In todays competive marketplace it is imperative to consider a MVP approach for a solution.

The area that I did not cover on the outset was **cybersecurity**. As designers and architects we are trained to deliver secure solutions and its an implied achitectural characteristic. Although it is implied, there is no harm highlighting it upfront. It is best to highlight principles such as **authentication** (authN) and **authorisation** (authZ) at this point.
Not all stakeholders are tech-savy and they just wanted to be assured that security is being considered.

The **cost** of change is an interesting factor to highlight early on. There are two areas that require some thought; Capital Expense (capex) and Operational Expense (opex). I remember being part of an architectural discussion where the agree design was cost prohibitive and was far-from to what was implemented.  

The **time-to-market** is imperative these days and designed are expected consider
 Minimum Viable Product (**MVP**) approach from ground up. The MVP approach is a great influencer as stakeholder are able to see a return on their investments early on. 

The **technology** is an interesting factor to consider early on. I think there is no harm considering the existing technology stack as the cost could increase if plethora of technologies are introduced.

## Solution options
Once the motivations are disussed, the next phase is to consider solution options. This is the **rubber-meet-the-road** moment where you'll be using your theory, pratice and experience to win the client.

In my case, I had three bullet points each discribing an option in one sentence. I wish I had presented a table as below highlighting key attributes instead of spending a lot of time discussing the options. I could have returned to this area at the end if the client require more informationn.

Option|Performance|Security|Complexity|UX
------|-----------|--------|----------|--
Option 1|High|High|Low| IFrame
Option 2|Low|High|High| Native

## Design
I had a diagram (lines-and-boxes) describing each system and their role/responsibility. Each connector was well highlighted and numbered. There was even **Keys** area where I described connectors. 

I do not think I faulted here, but again it is hard to say as the there was not much feedback from the client. 

## Build
I deliberately did not include any guidance on solution build. On hindsight, it would not have been wrong to mention some frameworks that are available. As an example, Swift programming language over Objective-C or Java over .NET. The point to hit home here is the fact that all the options are available and you are ready to guide them through. 

Since I did not present this information, it is hard to know what the reaction would have been. 

## Prototype
Picture tells a **thousand words**! There is absolutely no subsitute. A simple prototype view of the app or web-site would really hit the points home. I wish I had included few. 

## Next steps
No design presentation is complete without next actions. This is probably the worst mistake I made. I did not include one, instead I mentioned the next steps verbally. As a client I would love to hear what to expect next. 

## Takeaways
* Plan in advance.
* MVP! - This is very important.
* Clear diagram and make sure to add **Keys**.
* Cost - Use the money well!
* Include security and technology - It's OK to include.
* Mockups will be extremly useful.
* Next actions - Setup a workshop maybe.
* Last but not least - Make sure you have a good diagrammning tool. I use Lucid charts.

Knowing your audience is critical for effective communication. As you might expect, the same principle is applicable for design presentations too.

Preparing to deliver a design presentation require time and effort; so never **under-estimate**.

I presented a design to a prospective client recently. On first reaction, I thought I had done a pretty good job, but on relection I wish I had covered done more. 

My aim of this post is to highlight my shortcoming so you will not make the same mistake!

## Motivations
The motivations are factors that led me to the end solution. I highlighted the need to leverage local knowledge and buy-in from **stakeholders**.

The area that I did not cover was **cybersecurity**. As designers and architects we are trained to deliver security solution and its an implied achitectural characteristic. It is best to highlight principles such as **authentication** (authN) and **authorisation** (authZ) at this point.
Not all stakeholders are tech-savy and they just want assurance that it is being considered. Even though security is implied, it is critical to highlight during early engagement. 

The **cost** of change is an interesting factor to highlight early on. There are two areas that require redress; capex and opex. I remember being part of architural discussions where the collectionly agree design was cost prohibitive. There is a close link between the design and cost therefore stakeholder would like to know it is being considered.  

The **time-to-market** is so important these days and designed are expected consider
 Minimum Viable Product (**MVP**) approach from group up. The MVP approach is a great influencer as stakeholder are able to see some return on their investments early on. 

The **technology** is an interesting factor to consider early on. I think there is no harm considering the existing technology stack as the cost could increase if plethora of technologies are introduced.

## Solution options
Once the motivations are laid bare, the phase is to consider solution options. This is the rubber-meet-the-road moment. 

In my case I had three bullet points each discribing an option in one sentence. Instead of this format, I wish I had added advantages and disadvangaes for each, perhaps a table as following.

Option|Performance|Security|Complexity
------|-----------|--------|----------
Option 1|High|High|Low
Option 2|Low|Low|High

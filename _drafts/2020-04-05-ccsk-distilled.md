## 1. Cloud concepts 

* There are number of definitions for Cloud Computing. NIST defines it as "Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, **on-demand network** access to a **shared pool** of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be **rapidly provisioned** and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction".

* Essential characteristics (NIST)
 -Broad Network access 
 -Rapid Elasticity
 -Measured service (metered)
 -On-demand (self-service)
 -Multitenancy (included in ISO)

* Service Models (Sometimes called "SPI")
- Software as a Service (SAAS) (Applications)
- Platform as a Service (PAAS) (Managed SQL, File storage)
- Infrasturcture as a Service (IAAS) (Bare VMs)

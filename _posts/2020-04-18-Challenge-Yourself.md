I applied for a new role internally recently. I am not sure what the outcome would be, whatever that is; I am glad I applied for it!

There are many reasons why people move. In my case, it was two folds. The COVID pandemic has not been kind to my employer which brought a cloud of uncertainty to the business. Some colleagues left the business for greener postures and others for a complete change of career. The work itself was slowly becoming banal and considering the state of the world I was happy to be in employment. 

I decided to look around for a new opportunity externally and started navigating the job market. I read through a number of job postings that matched my job title, and I quickly discovered the need to calibrate my experience, which in some sense a good thing. 

## Courage 
I applied for a few opportunities and some did come back and others did not. In one instance I went through four rounds of interviews but never heard anything back. 

The frustration of job hunting was starting to bite and I decided to speak to a senior colleague. It was a tough decision to ask for help as I was not sure how he would react considering I should be working with the line management on my progression plan. Instead he very kindly listened to my frustrations and asked me to consider the following.

- What are the qualities in your current job that hold dear to you? Perhaps it's automation, quality etc. 
- Are you interested in new experiences? If so, my first point of call should be to obtain them internally. 
- Are you frustrated on how the organisation is structured, and governed? Then I should seriously consider leaving. 

He pointed me to the internal job board, especially two roles that will give me the experiences I desired. 

I had never applied for a position internally before. It was a bit odd since the role I applied was with a team I work very closely with. The role itself was quite different and required a new set of skills. Lots of thoughts raced in my mind; Do I need this job? Can I do it? What if I do not get it? I still have to interact with that team. Then I decided to think differently. 

## Take a risk
People are not born with skills needed for their roles. Instead they are acquired through learning and experiences. Books and tertiary education can take you so far, but it cannot take you to your destination; wherever that maybe. 

In any sport, you pretty much suck at the beginning and perhaps spend most of the time on the bench. Sitting on the bench offers you the time and space to observe others; which is quite valuable for an improver. A curious mind would jot down mental notes and use them in the future. I thought if I want this role in the future, I cannot be a spectator, instead I need to be sitting on that bench observing. 

## Interview
The day came and I was sitting in front of a couple of colleagues from the new team. That was a bit nerve racking. Gosh, how will I face them if I do not get this role? 
My mind went blank but I tried hard to focus my thoughts.

The questions were quite hard, they asked me questions that I knew I had answers but just could not express myself properly. At one point, I wanted it to stop! But I kept going and nervously answered questions I could. I politely declined to answer questions that I did not know instead of bluffing and wasting each other's times. 

Although the whole experience was quite difficult I walked away with lots of positives. I learnt the level of skills required for the new role and its challenges. Perhaps this is something I had underestimated before. I also learned to appreciate their work; it is quite hard.

## My feedback
I thought I'd turn the tide during my window for questions. I asked the colleagues how deep they expect in subject matter during the interview and whether those skills can be acquired in the job. I had good responses, which made me realise the gaps in my answers. 

Even though my experience in the interview was sub-par, I walked away with great positives. The best way to experience something is to take a risk and be part of the process. There is no point sitting idle and being grumpy about when you can train your brain matter. 

I would recommend anyone to apply internally and get that experience. Whatever the outcome, use it to your advantage and it will help you to get your next role, wherever that may be.
